Added a spike detection to prevent false-positive this keeps large/heavy blinds from stopping before the target location has been reached.\nDuration Interrupt â€“ Corrected duration interrupt problem. If a set command is sent while the blind is still processing a set command with a duration value the motor will now cancel the current duration command and handle the new command.",
