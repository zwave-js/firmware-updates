You can check your hardware version on the back of the ZEN52 module.\n* Updated parameter names and short descriptions in the Configuration Command Class for improved clarity and consistency.\n* Fixed an issue with LED behavior when the ZEN52 is included in a Z-Wave network — the LED now follows Parameter 1 settings as expected.\n* Resolved a mechanical switch issue that occurred when firmware version 1.80 was flashed to hardware version 1.10. The mechanical switch now functions properly on both hardware versions.\n* Bug Fix: Parameter 28 (DC Motor Mode) with value 2 now functions correctly when the ZEN52 is triggered using connected mechanical switches.",
