			"changelog": "* Includes firmware versions: 20.10, 20.20, 2.30\n* Fixed kWh Reporting Issue: Resolved an edge-case issue where ZEN15 could report inflated kWh values. The root cause was identified as the power metering chip not being properly cleared after an abnormal device restart.\n* Updated Factory Reset Behavior: Improved the factory reset procedure to ensure kWh data is fully cleared. After holding the button for 20 seconds, ZEN15 will now restore default settings and reset accumulated kWh values.\n* Optimized Power Report Frequency (Parameter 171): Changed the default value of Parameter 171 (Power Report Frequency) from 30 seconds to 300 seconds to reduce unnecessary traffic on the Z-Wave network.\n\t* Devices using the previous default value (30 seconds) will be automatically updated to 300 seconds.\n\t* Devices with a custom value configured will remain unchanged.",
